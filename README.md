Reading the CSV File
The script reads the pokemon_data.csv file and splits its contents into lines and columns. It then extracts the indices for the type1, type2, and name columns.

Filtering Pokémon by Type
The script defines a function pokemonType that takes the user input for type and filters the Pokémon names based on their primary or secondary type. The filtered names are then printed in a readable format.

Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to ensure that the user input matches the format of the types in the CSV file.
